# speakrs

Speaker diarization in Rust. Runs **312-912x realtime** on Apple Silicon (**20-50x faster than pyannote**) and **50-121x on CUDA** (**2-7x faster than pyannote**), matching pyannote accuracy.

`speakrs` implements the full pyannote `community-1` pipeline in Rust: segmentation, powerset decode, aggregation, binarization, embedding, PLDA, and VBx clustering, plus temporal smoothing during reconstruction. There is no Python dependency. Inference runs on ONNX Runtime or native CoreML, and all post-processing stays in Rust.

On VoxConverse dev (216 files), speakrs CoreML achieves **7.1% DER at 529x realtime** vs pyannote's 7.2% at 24x. On the test set (232 files) speakrs matches pyannote at 11.1% DER while running 27x faster. On CUDA, speakrs matches or beats pyannote DER on all datasets at 2-7x the speed. See [benchmarks/](benchmarks/) for full results across 8 datasets.

Speaker diarization in Rust

`speakrs` implements the full pyannote `community-1` speaker diarization pipeline:
segmentation, powerset decode, aggregation, binarization, embedding, PLDA, and VBx
clustering. There is no Python dependency. Inference runs on ONNX Runtime or native
CoreML, and all post-processing stays in Rust.

### Usage

```toml
# Apple Silicon (CoreML)
speakrs = { version = "0.3", features = ["coreml"] }

# NVIDIA GPU
speakrs = { version = "0.3", features = ["cuda"] }

# WebGPU (cross-platform, experimental)
speakrs = { version = "0.3", features = ["webgpu"] }

# CPU only (default)
speakrs = "0.3"
```

#### Quick start

```rust
use speakrs::{ExecutionMode, OwnedDiarizationPipeline};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
    let mut pipeline = OwnedDiarizationPipeline::from_pretrained(ExecutionMode::CoreMl)?;

    let audio: Vec<f32> = load_your_mono_16khz_audio_here();
    let result = pipeline.run(&audio)?;

    print!("{}", result.rttm("my-audio"));
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Speaker turns

```rust
use speakrs::pipeline::{FRAME_STEP_SECONDS, FRAME_DURATION_SECONDS};

let result = pipeline.run(&audio)?;

for segment in result.discrete_diarization.to_segments(FRAME_STEP_SECONDS, FRAME_DURATION_SECONDS) {
    println!("{:.3} - {:.3}  {}", segment.start, segment.end, segment.speaker);
}
```

#### Background queue

For processing many files, [`QueueSender`] and [`QueueReceiver`] run a background
worker that auto-batches requests for cross-file optimizations. Push files from
any thread, receive results as they complete:

```rust
use speakrs::{ExecutionMode, OwnedDiarizationPipeline, QueuedDiarizationRequest};

let pipeline = OwnedDiarizationPipeline::from_pretrained(ExecutionMode::CoreMl)?;
let (tx, rx) = pipeline.into_queued()?;

// producer: push files as they arrive from another thread
std::thread::spawn(move || {
    for (file_id, audio) in receive_files() {
        tx.push(QueuedDiarizationRequest::new(file_id, audio)).unwrap();
    }
    // tx drops when the producer is done, ending the rx loop
});

// results arrive while files are still being pushed,
// the loop exits once tx is dropped and all queued work is done
for result in rx {
    let result = result?;
    print!("{}", result.result?.rttm(&result.file_id));
}
```

#### Local models

For offline or airgapped usage, load models from a local directory:

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use speakrs::{ExecutionMode, OwnedDiarizationPipeline};

let mut pipeline = OwnedDiarizationPipeline::from_dir(
    Path::new("/path/to/models"),
    ExecutionMode::Cpu,
)?;
let result = pipeline.run(&audio)?;
```

### Pipeline

```text
Audio (16kHz f32)
  │
  ├─ Segmentation ──────→ raw 7-class logits per 10s window
  │   (ONNX or CoreML)
  │
  ├─ Powerset Decode ───→ 3-speaker soft/hard activations
  │
  ├─ Overlap-Add ───────→ Hamming-windowed aggregation across windows
  │
  ├─ Binarize ──────────→ hysteresis thresholding + min-duration filtering
  │
  ├─ Embedding ─────────→ 256-dim WeSpeaker vectors per segment
  │   (ONNX or CoreML)
  │
  ├─ PLDA Transform ────→ 128-dim whitened features
  │
  ├─ VBx Clustering ────→ Bayesian HMM speaker assignments
  │
  ├─ Reconstruct ───────→ map clusters back to frame-level activations (temporal smoothing)
  │
  └─ Segments ──────────→ RTTM output
```

### macOS / iOS (CoreML)

Requires the `coreml` Cargo feature. Uses Apple's CoreML framework for
GPU/ANE-accelerated inference.

#### Execution modes

| Mode | Backend | Step | Precision | Use case |
|------|---------|------|-----------|----------|
| `coreml` | Native CoreML | 1s | FP32 | Best accuracy (529x realtime) |
| `coreml-fast` | Native CoreML | 2s | FP32 | Best speed (912x realtime) |

`coreml-fast` uses a wider step (2s instead of 1s) to get about 1.5x more speed.
That follows the same throughput-first tradeoff
[SpeakerKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) uses on Apple hardware. It
matches `coreml` on most clips, but on some inputs the coarser step loses temporal
resolution at speaker boundaries.

#### Benchmarks

All benchmarks on Apple M4 Pro, macOS 26.3, evaluated on VoxConverse dev
(216 files, 1217.8 min, collar=0ms):

| Mode | DER | Time | RTFx |
|------|-----|------|------|
| `coreml` | **7.1%** | 138s | 529x |
| `coreml-fast` | 7.4% | 169s | 434x |
| pyannote community-1 (MPS) | 7.2% | 2999s | 24x |
| SpeakerKit | 7.8% | 234s | 312x |

On VoxConverse test (232 files, 2612.2 min), `coreml` matches pyannote at 11.1%
DER while running at 631x realtime vs pyannote's 23x.

CoreML results may differ slightly from ONNX CPU, the two runtimes apply different
graph optimizations (operator fusion, reduction order) that change floating-point
rounding, even on CPU in FP32. Apple's own measurements show ~96 dB SNR between
CoreML FP32 and source frameworks
([typed execution docs](https://apple.github.io/coremltools/docs-guides/source/typed-execution.html)).
See [benchmarks/](https://github.com/avencera/speakrs/tree/master/benchmarks) for
full results across multiple datasets.

#### Choosing a mode

The accuracy gap between `coreml` and `coreml-fast` depends on the type of audio.
On meeting recordings with orderly turn-taking (AMI), CoreML Fast matches CoreML
within 0.4% DER. On broadcast content with frequent speaker changes (VoxConverse),
the gap is ~0.3%. On some datasets like Earnings-21, CoreML Fast actually beats
CoreML on DER.

`coreml-fast` never misses speech or hallucinates extra speech. The only extra
errors are misattributing speech to the wrong speaker near turn boundaries, because
the 2s step gives fewer data points to pinpoint where one speaker stops and another
starts.

See [benchmarks/](https://github.com/avencera/speakrs/tree/master/benchmarks) for
full results across all datasets.

### CPU, CUDA, and WebGPU (Linux, Windows, macOS)

Works on any platform with ONNX Runtime. No special Cargo features needed for CPU.
Enable the `cuda` feature for NVIDIA GPU acceleration, or `webgpu` for cross-platform
WebGPU acceleration.

#### Execution modes

| Mode | Backend | Step | Precision | Use case |
|------|---------|------|-----------|----------|
| `cpu` | ORT CPU | 1s | FP32 | Reference |
| `cuda` | ORT CUDA | 1s | FP32 | Best accuracy |
| `cuda-fast` | ORT CUDA | 2s | FP32 | Best speed |
| `webgpu` | ORT WebGPU | 1s | FP32 | Cross-platform (experimental) |
| `webgpu-fast` | ORT WebGPU | 2s | FP32 | Cross-platform throughput (experimental) |

#### WebGPU

WebGPU provides hardware acceleration on any platform with a WebGPU-compatible GPU:
- **Windows**: DirectX 11/12
- **Linux**: Vulkan, OpenGL/GLES
- **macOS**: Metal

Requires the `webgpu` Cargo feature. Note that WebGPU binaries are mutually exclusive
with CUDA in prebuilt builds. If you need both CUDA and WebGPU support, compile ONNX
Runtime from source.

**Warning**: The WebGPU execution provider is experimental and may produce incorrect
results or crashes. Report issues upstream to the ONNX Runtime project.

#### Benchmarks

NVIDIA RTX 4090, AMD EPYC 7B13, evaluated on VoxConverse dev
(216 files, 1217.8 min, collar=0ms):

| Mode | DER | Time | RTFx |
|------|-----|------|------|
| `cuda` | **7.0%** | 1236s | 59x |
| `cuda-fast` | 7.4% | 604s | **121x** |
| pyannote community-1 (CUDA) | 7.2% | 2312s | 32x |

On VoxConverse test (232 files, 2612.2 min, L40S), `cuda` matches pyannote at
11.1% DER at 50x realtime vs pyannote's 18x.

### Models

Models download automatically on first use from
[avencera/speakrs-models](https://huggingface.co/avencera/speakrs-models) on
HuggingFace. If you want a custom model directory, set `SPEAKRS_MODELS_DIR`.

### Public API

| Module / Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| [`OwnedDiarizationPipeline`] | Main entry point, owns models and runs diarization |
| [`QueueSender`] / [`QueueReceiver`] | Background worker split into push and drain halves |
| [`DiarizationPipeline`] | Borrowed pipeline for manual model lifetime control |
| [`DiarizationResult`] | All outputs: segments, embeddings, clusters, RTTM |
| [`ExecutionMode`] | CPU, CoreML, CoreMLFast, CUDA, CUDAFast, WebGPU, WebGPURast |
| [`PipelineConfig`] / [`RuntimeConfig`] | Tunable pipeline and hardware parameters |
| [`Segment`] | A single speaker turn with start/end times |
| [`ModelManager`] | Automatic model download from HuggingFace |
| [`inference`] | Segmentation and embedding model wrappers |
| [`segment`] | Segment conversion, merging, RTTM formatting |

### Why not pyannote-rs?

[pyannote-rs](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/pyannote-rs) is another Rust
diarization crate, but it uses a simpler pipeline instead of the full pyannote
algorithm:

| | speakrs | pyannote-rs |
|-|---------|-------------|
| Segmentation | Powerset decode → 3-speaker activations | Raw argmax on logits (binary speech/non-speech) |
| Aggregation | Hamming-windowed overlap-add | None (per-window only) |
| Binarization | Hysteresis + min-duration filtering | None |
| Embedding model | WeSpeaker ResNet34 (same as pyannote) | WeSpeaker CAM++ (only ONNX model they ship) |
| Clustering | PLDA + VBx (Bayesian HMM) | Cosine similarity with fixed 0.5 threshold |
| Speaker count | VBx EM estimation | Capped by max_speakers parameter |
| pyannote parity | Bit-exact on CPU/CUDA | No, different algorithm and different embedding model |

On the VoxConverse dev set, using the 33 files where pyannote-rs produces output
(186 min, collar=0ms):

| | DER | Missed | False Alarm | Confusion |
|-|-----|--------|-------------|-----------|
| speakrs CoreML | 11.5% | 3.8% | 3.6% | 4.1% |
| pyannote-rs | 80.2% | 34.9% | 7.4% | 37.9% |

pyannote-rs produces 0 segments on 183 out of 216 VoxConverse files. Its segments
only close on speech to silence transitions, so continuous speech without silence
gaps yields no output. The 33 files above are the subset where it produces at least
5 segments.

Note: pyannote-rs's README says it uses `wespeaker-voxceleb-resnet34-LM`, but their
[build instructions](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/pyannote-rs/blob/main/BUILDING.md)
and [GitHub release](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/pyannote-rs/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
only ship `wespeaker_en_voxceleb_CAM++.onnx`. There is no ONNX export of
ResNet34-LM. The
[HuggingFace repo](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/wespeaker-voxceleb-resnet34-LM)
only contains `pytorch_model.bin`. The benchmark here uses pyannote-rs exactly as
documented in their setup instructions.

### Features

- **`online`** (default) — automatic model download from HuggingFace via [`ModelManager`]
- **`coreml`** — native CoreML backend for Apple Silicon GPU/ANE acceleration
- **`cuda`** — NVIDIA CUDA backend via ONNX Runtime
- **`webgpu`** — cross-platform WebGPU backend via ONNX Runtime (experimental)
- **`load-dynamic`** — load the CUDA runtime library at startup instead of static linking

### Build requirements

This crate links OpenBLAS statically (via `ndarray-linalg`), which requires a C compiler.
On most systems this is already available. The ONNX Runtime dependency (`ort` 2.0.0-rc.12)
is pre-release.
